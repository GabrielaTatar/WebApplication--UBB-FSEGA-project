# WebApplication_DRUGSTORE

I created an ASP.NET Core Web App type project, where we have an application for a drugstore. There were several branches created, each containing another functionality. In the project, I used the Razor Identity class library to create the authentication. Moreover, the created application is the online version for a store, where we have products, brands, categories, purchases etc.
